    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This Salvadoran staple can be made with extremely simple ingredients. Hell, you could be in an active warzone and make this!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>corn flour (Maseca is preferred)</li>
        <li>cheese (traditionally a Salvadoran melting cheese but Oaxacan or Mozzerella works in a pinch)</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>First, you're going to make a kind of dough out of a magical balance of corn flour, water and a little salt. Not too sticky and not too dry is the key. This step is the most important (and difficult) part!</p>
    <p>Once the dough is nice and pliable, take a small ball and flatten it in the palm of your hand into a disc</p>
    <p>Next, add the cheese (not too much) into the middle of your disc. Optionally, you could add refried beans, pork, etc. Go crazy!</p>
    <p>Wrap the disc into a small ball, make sure all the ingredients are nice and covered inside.</p>
    <p>With the proto-pupusa ball in hand, start to massage it into a disc-like shape. Be careful not to let it rip!</p>
    <p>Last step! Heat up a pan and add a tiny bit of oil before tossing your pupusa down. Flip as needed. Once it's nice and browned (with a couple of burnt cheese spots), it's done. Serve with curtido.</p>
    <p><strong>If you're a real guerilla fighter (or just my boomer aunt) you flip piping hot pupusas by hand!</strong></p>
